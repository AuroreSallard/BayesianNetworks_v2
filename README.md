# BayesianNetworks_v2
We will try to use the Python package "pomegranate" (https://pomegranate.readthedocs.io/en/latest/BayesianNetwork.html) to generate synthetic activity chains from BN.
Hopefully, if this works as expected, we will include more features to the networks - week-end or seasonal models, activity restrictions, household interactions...
